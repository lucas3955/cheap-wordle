# cheap-wordle
A wordle remake I made in Python (w/pygame) in ~6 hours as an enrichment project. 

Because of the limited time I had to do it I didn't do anything with private or protected subroutines/attributes. I also got lazy with names and comments :/

It's a little buggy but the core functionality is pretty much there.
